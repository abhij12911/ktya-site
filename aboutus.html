    <p><b>Introduction</b>:
        Krishna Township Youth Association (KTYA) is a community-based organization that has been serving the residents of Krishna Township for over 27 years. We are dedicated to preserving and promoting the cultural heritage of our community through the celebration of traditional festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi and Navratra, as well as through various social and community service activities.
    <div class="about">
        <b>About Us:</b>
        KTYA was formed in 1994 by a group of young residents of Krishna Township who wanted to bring the community together and preserve the cultural traditions of their ancestors. Over the years, our organization has grown and evolved, but our mission has remained the same - to promote and preserve the cultural heritage of our community through the celebration of traditional festivals and through various social and community service activities.

KTYA organizes a grand celebration of this festival every year, complete with traditional prayers, music, and dance performances, and a grand procession of Lord Ganesha's idol.
